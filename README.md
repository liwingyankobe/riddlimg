Are you annoyed by using so many apps to check a single image?
Do you often forget some steps when checking images?

[**RiddlImg**](https://thestringharmony.com/riddlimg/) is a web application that collects many
common tricks for images used in online riddles. It is created by Kobe Li (infiniteXforever),
an experienced online riddle player and the creator of the online riddle
[The String Harmony](https://thestringharmony.com/).

Although RiddlImg is designed for online riddles, it is equally applicable in related contexts
such as CTF. Please share this tool to your community if you like it :)
